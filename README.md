# Data-Analytics-Portfolio

About Me
I first stepped into the world of data analytics by pursuing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, Coming from a background in HR consulting and claims adjusting, I realized that data isn’t just numbers. What currently interests me is uncovering trends that shape decisions. My main areas of interest include business analytics, data visualization, and decision support systems. I’m especially drawn to projects that improve efficiency, highlight opportunities for growth, and use data to bridge the gap between operations and strategy.
